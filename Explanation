2)Considering JSON dataset writing the functions:-

1st function--Function to take pokemons name as argument and display the information of that pokemon
 
firstly,assigning all json object into fullGame variable then first function is as follows:-

DisplayPokemon() function takes an argument as name of the pokemon i.e n=pokemonName,
           i.e initialise flag=0 to indicate if given name is in the json file or not
           ->using for loop that iterates to all the fullGame.pokemon data
           ->with if condition check weather given name is equal to fullGame.pokemon[i].name
                  if true then display the all pokemon data in alert message ;
                  then break out of loop 
           ->else no match then  flag=1;
           ->finally check if flag=1 
                           then wrong pokemon name

2nd function--Function that takes pokemons name as an argument and finds out which all pokemon have that name in their next_evolution field.

    findnextEvolutionPokemon(n)
      takes an argument as name of the pokemon 
          i.e n=pokemonName
          i.e initialise flag=0 to indicate if given name is in the valid or not
           ->use for loop that iterates to all the fullGame.pokemon data
           ->use another loop to iterates fullGame.pokemon[i].next_evolution array
           ->with if condition check weather given name is equal to fullGame.pokemon[  i].next_evolution[j].name 
           -> if true then display the all pokemon data Pokemon Name whose next_evolution was given pokemon name in console ;
              then break out of loop 
            ->else no match then  flag=1;
              finally check if flag=1 
                              then wrong pokemon name ,no pokemon have given pokemon name as next evolution pokemon

3rd function--Function that take a Weakness as an input and gives the names of all pokemon who have that Weakness. 

     findWeakness();
          takes an argument as name of the pokemon 
          i.e n=pokemonName
          i.e initialise flag=0 to indicate if given weakness is in the json file or not
           ->use for loop that iterates to all the fullGame.pokemon data
           ->with if condition check weather given weakness is equal to any pokemon weakness
                  if true then display the  pokemon name in console ;
                  then break out of loop 
           ->else no match then  flag=1;
                  finally check if flag=1 
                                then wrong pokemon name
